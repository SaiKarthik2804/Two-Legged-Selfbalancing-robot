This is my Course Work Project Which is about developing a two-legged self-balancing robot with Adjustable height using a parallel leg mechanism

In this project, The Following Hardware is used

1. 1 x ESP32 Dev Module  
2. 1 x PS4 Controller
3. 4 x RDS3235 Digital Servo 270 Degree
4. 1 x Adafruit PCA9685 16-Channel Servo Driver
5. 2 x Pololu Items #4742, #4752 (30:1 Metal Gearmotor 37D 12V)
6. 1 x 7A/160W H-Bridge High Power DC Motor Driver Module
7. 1 x BNO085 IMU 9DOF
8. 1 x Bread Board

For the Software part Arduino IDE is used for programming in C++, programming in micro-python for esp32 is optional


The Simulation part of this project Has been Done in Simulink Simscape Library
